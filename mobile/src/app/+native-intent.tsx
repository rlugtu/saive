 * Intercepts incoming deep links before expo-router tries to match them as routes.

 * deep link like `saive://dataUrl=<ShareKey>...`. That isn't a real route, so expo-router
 * would otherwise render the "Unmatched Route" (+not-found) screen. We redirect it to `/`
 * and let `ShareIntentProvider` / `ShareIntentRouter` (in `_layout.tsx`) pick up the shared
 * payload and navigate to the new-bookmark flow.
