 * Bearer session token for authenticating API calls.
 *
 * We can't rely on the session **cookie** for the tRPC client: in an iOS release build over
 * HTTPS the native networking layer intercepts `Secure` Set-Cookie headers into its own store,
 * so `@better-auth/expo` never captures them and `authClient.getCookie()` comes back empty —
 * which is why TestFlight requests were rejected as "Sign in required". Instead the web server
 * runs better-auth's `bearer()` plugin, which emits the session token in a plain `set-auth-token`
 * response header (not swallowed by the cookie machinery) and accepts `Authorization: Bearer`.
 *
 * We mirror the token in memory (sync reads for request headers) and in SecureStore (survives
 * restarts). `fetchOptions.onSuccess` below refreshes it whenever better-auth rotates it.
 *
 * The `set-auth-token` header only rides on **fetch** responses (email/password sign-in), so it
 * never fires for the Google OAuth flow — there the session arrives as a `cookie` query param on
 * the `klect://` deep-link redirect, which `@better-auth/expo` stores but our client never sees as
 * a response. `resolveBearerToken` therefore falls back to the stored session cookie, whose
 * session-token value the server's `bearer()` plugin accepts as a bearer token.
