        Klect is a bookmarking app where your bookmarks live inside shareable lists. This policy
        explains, in plain terms, what information Klect collects, how it’s used, who it’s shared
        with, and the choices you have — including how to delete your account and all of your data.

        <p className="text-muted text-sm">We only collect what the app needs to work:</p>
        <ul className="text-muted text-sm flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            <span className="text-ink">Account details</span> — your email address, your unique
            @handle, and anything you choose to add to your profile (name, birthday, avatar, and
            theme).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="text-ink">Content you create</span> — your lists and bookmarks
            (names, descriptions, links, photos, notes, ratings, tags), comments, poll votes,
            direct messages, and list chatroom messages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="text-ink">Location you add</span> — if you attach a place to a
            bookmark or use “Near me,” we store the location you pick. “Near me” reads your device’s
            current location on-device to find bookmarks nearby; that live location is not stored.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="text-ink">Sign-in data</span> — if you sign in with Google, we receive
            your basic Google account info to authenticate you. If you use email and password, your
            password is stored only as a secure one-way hash.
